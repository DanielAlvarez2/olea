SALES PITCH ***********************************  
Vicente Caride photos  
show on mobile: press page some images left-aligned,  
random "Book now" link??? in graphics column of press page    
get control over special event menus (NYE, Mothers Day, Yale Grad/Parents Day, Restaurant Week, etc...)  
"I'm trying to decide between this dish and that dish...?" --> show pics!!!  
broken links are bad for SEO ranking  
often see people look back and forth between paper menu and their phone, they are looking at pics 
from google, yelp, etc and trying to match those pics to a menu description  
DURING RESTAURANT WEEK:  
customer ordered lamb shank rice dish...  
ate half of it...  
said: 'it wasn't what I was expecting'...  
asked to get the polenta dish instead...  
took 2 bites, then wrapped the rest to go...  
if he had seen a photo of the dish before ordering...  
likely would not have happened
